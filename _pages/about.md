I'm Dan (종민) Lee from Long Island, currently based in NYC. I'm
interested broadly in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Recently in my research, I've thought about the question of general intelligence.
Specifically, ***how can models learn representations that are transferable to
diverse domains and learn continually?***. My current work explores synthetic
data as a means to learn a universal representation or computational priors to
adapt across domains.

Outside of research, I love cooking, hiking, working out, playing TFT, and
reading. I'm particularly drawn to literature that explores identity, abstraction, and
meaning.

I'm currently a research collaborator at MIT CSAIL with Professor Pulkit Agrawal. Previously, I was an early-stage technology and software investor.
