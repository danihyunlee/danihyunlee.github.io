About Me
======
My name is Dan. I'm currently a growth investor at Bregal Sagemount, where I invest in capital efficient software and tech-enabled services businesses. Prior to Sagemount, I was an investment banker in the Technology M&A group at Evercore.

Previously, I graduated summa cum laude from Columbia University with a BEng in Computer Science (Intelligent Systems & Machine Learning Track) and a minor in Economics, where I was a Egleston Scholar. I was fortunate to be mentored by Michael Burke, with whom I worked on computer vision-based methods to extract experimental data for combustion simulations. At Columbia, I also worked as a head TA for Data Structures (COMS 3134).

In my spare time, I enjoy coding, running, bouldering, guitar, and reading; my favorite authors include Haruki Murakami and Kurt Vonnegut.
