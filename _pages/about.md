I'm interested in developing methods that learn general intelligence—interpretable representations that transfer across diverse domains. My research explores synthetic data pretraining and alternative training paradigms beyond next-token prediction.

Currently, I'm a research collaborator at MIT CSAIL's [Improbable AI Lab](https://improbable.ai/) with Professor [Pulkit Agrawal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/), where I explore how synthetic training distributions can improve model generalization and data efficiency.

## Research Interests

- **Synthetic pretraining** — Using algorithmic and synthetic data to address limitations in natural language
- **Training paradigms** — Exploring objectives beyond next-token prediction for improved generalization
- **Transfer learning** — Understanding what characteristics of training data enable transfer across domains

## Background

Previously, I was a growth investor at [Bregal Sagemount](https://www.bregalsagemount.com/) and an investment banker at [Evercore's](https://www.evercore.com/) Technology M&A group. Working with software companies showed me how ML models struggle with adaptability across contexts—sparking my curiosity about fundamental approaches to learning general intelligence.

I graduated *summa cum laude* from Columbia University with a B.S. in Computer Science (Intelligent Systems & ML Track) and a minor in Economics, where I was an Egleston Scholar.

At Columbia, I worked with Professor [Michael Burke](https://www.me.columbia.edu/faculty/michael-burke) on computer vision methods for automated data extraction from combustion experiments, and served as Head TA for Data Structures (COMS 3134).

## Beyond Research

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, cooking, photography, reading, working out, and playing TFT. I'm particularly drawn to literature that explores identity, abstraction, and meaning—with favorites including Haruki Murakami, Kurt Vonnegut, and Hermann Hesse.
