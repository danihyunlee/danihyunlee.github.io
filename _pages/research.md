## Past Research

### Computer Vision for Combustion Research
**Columbia University, Burke Lab** | 2019–2021

Developed computer vision methods to automate data extraction from graphs of combustion experiments, reducing processing time from hours to minutes. This work supported experimental data mining for combustion simulations.

*Advisor: Professor Michael Burke*

### Multi-Modal Policy Robustness
**Columbia University** | 2021

Explored the robustness of multi-modal long-horizon policies for robotics, demonstrating that input modality diversity improves policy robustness to input noise.
